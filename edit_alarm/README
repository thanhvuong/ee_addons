WIKI SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
To use edit alerts in the wiki, you will need to make small additions to
your wiki theme(s).

You can edit your wiki themes at CP Home > Modules > Wiki > Wiki Themes

Two variables are used:

	{edit_alarm_message} - replaced by the edit alert message
	{edit_alarm_css} - replaced by the CSS in the extension settings

You can use these however you see fit.  One suggested way is to put the
following within the <style> tag in your HTML <head> section:

	#editAlarm {
	{edit_alarm_css}
	}

And then in the page just within the primary content area, place the
following.  In the Default theme this is the <div> with the id "article".
In the Azure theme this is the <div> with the id "content".

	{if edit_alarm}<div id="editAlarm">{edit_alarm_message}</div>{/if}

Or for instance if you would prefer that edit alerts not ever be displayed
when viewing an article:

	{if edit_alarm && edit_article}<div id="editAlarm">{edit_alarm_message}</div>{/if}


I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WIKI INSTRUCTIONS:
And if you don't understand any of the wiki instructions, Here is what you do
assuming you are using the default template:

Edit 'Wiki Page' template and add the following inside your <head></head>:

<style>
	#editAlarm {
	{edit_alarm_css}
	}
</style>

Edit 'Wiki Edit' template and add the following right after {if can_edit}

{if edit_alert}<div id="editAlert">{edit_alert_message}</div>{/if}
